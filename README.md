## Future Update Ideas

- More Personal Best time frames (10, 20, 100 years)
- More random events (Good quarter earnings, buyouts, bankruptcies)
- Limit market crash percentages (Should not reach 100%)
- Display the current year.
- Pause the simulation to sell/buy stocks.
- Portfolio summary (add type of stock and amount purchased to a list to make dividends possible)
